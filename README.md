# kcci-plaintext
kcci.com in plain text


KCCI DSM's website, it sucks. Lots of adds and clickbait. I wanted to learn python flask so I decided to write a simple page that scrapes kcci.com to pull the local stories in and display in plain text.

They only keep 6 local stories on the main page, the rest are national/world news or obvious clickbait so I just keep the top 6 stories.
